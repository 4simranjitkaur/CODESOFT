# CODESOFT
This repository contain the valuable efforts regarding projects assigned to me during my CODESOFT Internship . This intership was a bundle of opportunities for me as student to not only understand the process of analysis but also to implement it with real world examples.

#INITIATION 

Under this intership we were provided with 5 tasks out of which one needs to complete at least 3 tasks for successful completion of the internship.The five tasks included Titanic survival prediction, Movie rating prediction with python,Iris classification,Sales prediction using python,Credit card fraud detection. Out of these five my three best suited were Titanic survival,Iris classification,Sales prediction using python using various techniques and libraries including:-
1) pandas
2) numpy
3) matplotlib
4) warnings
5) sk learn
6) seaborn etc

BRIEF ELABORATION OF TASKS:-

TASK 1 [TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION] 

Used the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived. With initial preprocessing I have cleaned the data such that all the unnecessary rows or columns would get removed , all the null values are checked using a heatmap and are erased and only required data is left for futher analysis.With the help of this clean data,now the graphs ( bar and histogram used ) are being plotted for the better understanding of the situation and building the realtionship between the survival rate amongst other factors such as gender, sex, age and a collective subplot of the the survival of diffrent age groups such as elders, youngster or middle aged etc.This has been one of the simplest an dbegginner friendly project to start with and it was a great,joyful and a wonderful learning experience. 

TASK 2 [SALES PREDICTION]

Sales prediction involved forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.Initially sales analysis (of TV , Radio , Newspaper) with help of graphs was checked . It has been noticed that TV has maximiun number of sales followed by Radio and the least with Newspaper   With the help of machine learning algorithm and importing sk learn library for train and test model to check the accuracy of the predicted model. I utilized machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. 

TASK 3 [IRIS CLASSIFICATION] 

The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. I used the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. After all the preprocessing  it the firstly seen the amount all sepal and petal that are avaliable of each kind. further after using sk learn (linear reggression algorithm ) the data was put in a train and test model for classification and accuracy testing. usinf conditional statements the data was first diffrenciated by only one factor i.e petal width but further after the data was condition with each single parametre that was provided to classify the species. 

CONCLUSION 

I want to thank CODESOFT Team  and everyone at the company for their patience and assistance during my training. Thanks to their guidance and the tasks during the internship allowed me to develop more analytical skils . I think I still require to work on my hand with machine learning algorithms. But, the overall experience was great and everything I learned was useful in my career in this field.
